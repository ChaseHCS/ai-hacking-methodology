Each `LLM` or `AI` in an enterprise has a specific use case. These might include:

- Image Generation
- Text Generation
- Video Generation
- Audio Generation
- Email Sending & Receiving
- Chatbot

These aare just a couple examples and as you can probably imagine, the more agency you give an `LLM`, the more vulnerable they are to attackers. I feel that even though you use similar `techniques` to exploit the different kinds of `AI`, it is important to show specific examples for each type of AI.
